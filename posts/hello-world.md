Some thoughts about the growing journey 
---
This is my first post while the blog is still in development. 
Usually, we only start blogging after the site is officially launched.
But I thought it would be interesting to start blogging when the site is still incubating. 
I will update the blog development process along the way 
and it's a good idea to save some thoughts to look back in the future to see how much I was growing over time.

Anyway, this blog is intended to be a space 
where I publish all of my writing from now on. 
I would write about all sorts of stuff, 
but mostly about programming, engineering, and personal thoughts in English or Vietnamese.

I look forward to see how things will turn out in the future!
